# ThePinkAndBlueBook
The Pink&amp;Blue Book is an app designed to service the Trans and Non-Binary community in the Boston Area
This project reinforces my understanding on the core concepts of Node.JS and Javascript ES6 features and their applications. I wanted to keep my code as simple as possible. I wanted to do a throwpack theme for this project! The product came out clean, eye catching and fun! By the end of it. I'm excited for the future projects, so stay tuned!
